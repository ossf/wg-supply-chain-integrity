# Supply Chain Integrity WG

## Objective

The objective of the Supply Chain Integrity Working Group (WG) is to provide a global community for collaborating to help individuals and organizations assess and improve the security of end-to-end supply chains for open source software.

## Motivation

Supply chain issues and attacks cause significant damage worldwide including lost revenue, costs of ransomware payments, costs of mitigation, denial of access to resources, reduced customer trust, and public deception. As a matter of public trust, governments are beginning to mandate actions aimed at improving the security and integrity of supply chains. The [US White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) is one such example.

## Antitrust policy

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy>. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
